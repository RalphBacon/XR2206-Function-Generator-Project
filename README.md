# XR2206 Function Generator Project
Build a cheap, simple function (signal, waveform) generator (not a sponsored project)
# See video #97  at https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon

Here's an uber simple project for generating square waves, sine waves and triangle waves, ideal for general electronics use and for use in Arduino projects too. A simple project like this is also ideal for electronics beginners, with limited soldering skills.

CD4093 Quad Dual Input NAND Gate used in the demo as Schmitt trigger

CD4093 for demo purposes is OK but better would be to use a Hex (Six) Single Input Texas Instruments SN74HC14

(see page 3 for the debounce circuit)  
(see page 4 for pretty much what I described on converting wave forms)

The function (signal) generator kit, here is a link to Amazon but  
widely available from the Far Eastern Warehouses too, even cheaper there
